# polydogs
#A tamagotchi/nintendogs style defi game on the polygon network

#Feautres:
Buy dogs, 5k at start
Random mint

#Roadmap
Step 1
1. Mint 5k dogs at ?? MATIC
2.  Dogs have different traits based on rarity
3.  Dogs have generations that cap the breed rate (prevent a ton of breeding)

Step 2
1. Release staking, stake dogs in dog house to earn $BONES
2. $BONES are used for breeding(burned after) and will be used for walks/quests 

Step 3
1. Dogs will be able to go on x walks per day for a fee of x $BONES which will be burned
2. Dogs can bring back items(NFTS) from walks which give them better stats for staking, breeding, additional walks
